# sgi-vfc
This repository is to make SGI / IRIX Video Format Compiler (vfc) specification files available
## No license
Nothing placed here should be licensed or protected.
Nothing is guaranteed
This is just to help others to use or publish additional .vfs specs and montitor data
## Compiling .vfs files
1. Install the Video Format Compiler
2. Create your .vfs spec
3. Compile for your specific graphics system
NOTE: .vfo files are specific to a given graphics type
      But your special monitor .vfs spec can be compiled against different graphics architecture definitions
      So you have source rather than binary compatability
